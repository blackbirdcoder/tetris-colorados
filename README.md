This is a Tetris game that I created primarily to gain programming experience and for fun. The creation of the game was aided by my ability to learn from others, my passion for programming and creativity, my interest in drawing, and my desire to come up with interesting solutions and become a more skilled programmer.

And it all started with a simple marathon and the desire to have a great weekend...
